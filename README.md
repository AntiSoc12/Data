# Data

A file containing code and results for comparsions between Integer encoding and One Hot encoding.

In total there are four Raw data docuemnts, labelled RQ1, RQ3, RQ4.1 and RQ4.2.
In each file the first row is a discription of the label that I am going to be predicting, which file in the FLASH dataset it is from, the algorithm that is being used and the encoding scheme. 
The second row is the 50 RMSE values that have been produced from running it through the algoithms under their specific requirements. This could be Hyperparameter optimisation, Feature Selection or Default parameter values. 
The final row is the Execution time in seconds. It repersents how long it takes to run the algorithm when training the data. 

Also my Python code will also be avaliable. 

There will be a file called "a12.m". This contains the code (in Matlab) for which one may want to perform A12 effect size.
